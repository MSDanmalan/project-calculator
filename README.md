# project-calculator
A responsive, web-based calculator built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This project showcases my ability to structure logic-heavy applications with clean modular code and custom display management—ideal for highlighting front-end skills in a technical portfolio.

## 🔧 Features
- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- Extra functions: percentage, decimal point, toggle sign (+/-), and all-clear (AC)
- Operates with real-time input display updates
- Handles edge cases like malformed expressions and division by zero
- Clean, styled user interface using CSS Grid
- Fully responsive layout for various screen sizes

## 📁 Tech Stack
- HTML5 & CSS3: Semantically structured layout and responsive styling
- Vanilla JavaScript: ES6+ syntax, event-driven programming
- No libraries or frameworks used—demonstrates raw JS proficiency

## 🧠 Highlights
- Custom logic engine to parse operands, manage state, and evaluate expressions without relying on eval()
- Dynamic display logic: upper and lower display areas show current input and result
- Operator chaining with immediate feedback
- Modular JavaScript functions for clarity and reuse
- Clear separation of concerns: UI structure (HTML), styling (CSS), and behavior (JavaScript)

## 🛠️ Development Practices
- Manual DOM manipulation for maximum control
- Consistent naming conventions
- Clear separation between input handling, display logic, and math operations
- Defensive programming to prevent malformed or invalid calculations
